Updated: August 30th, 2018

Folders:
data: contains the HARP and MxA3 data, as well as Peter's version with calculated y error
plots_results: contains outputted plots and screenshots
presentation_photo: various plots and photos for my presentation


Notebooks (roughly in order from older to newer): 
linear_fit_testing.ipynb 
	- simple chi-sq fit

exact_emcee_example.ipynb
	- exact example in emcee documentation

emcee_example_data.ipynb
	- emcee example with the HARP data

mcmc.ipynb
	- includes both assumed 10% uncertainty version and inferred uncertainty version

week2.ipynb
	- includes coding up of eq 35 (2D uncertainty and scatter likelihood)

bias.ipynb -- test_nobias.ipynb 
	- attempt to include bias by using scatter-like term
	- second is the same but without bias parameter

non_gaussian_likeli.ipynb
	- first attempt with eq 22 likelihood

no_scatter_eq22_2gauss.ipynb -- no_scatter_eq22_3gauss.ipynb
	- mixture of 2 and 3 Gaussians

matrix_eq22.ipynb
	- Sundar's matrix version of the likelihood
	- "final" version of the MCMC method

mcmc_fakedata.ipynb
	- testing MCMC method on fake generated datasets

forward_modeling.ipynb
	- includes various extra variations on the functions provided in the
	cleaned up script, as well as diagnostic plots


Cleaned up scripts (with functions and function descriptions):
forward_modeling.py
matrix_eq22.py


Other:
Rebecca_ASIAA_SSP_2018_Report.pdf
	- my final writeup
Rebecca - ASIAA SSP 2018 Presentation.pdf
	- slides from my final presention
remove_output.py
	- clears ipynb output, useful if plots/results are taking too long to load

Files with .p extension contain Python dictionaries with results from the forward modeling grid 
and can be read using: 
	import pickle
	dict = pickle.load(open("filename.p", "rb"))
